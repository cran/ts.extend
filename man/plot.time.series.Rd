\description{
This is a custom plot function that operates on objects of class \code{time.series} (which is the output generated from the \code{rGARMA}
function).  This plot function generates a scatterplot matrix of time-series vectors using either \code{ggplot} or \code{base} graphics.
The user must input either a single time-series vector \code{x} or a matrix \code{x} where each row is one time-series vector.  The function
generates a scatterplot matrix showing each of the time-series.  If the plot is generated using \code{ggplot} graphics then the user has an
option to include a background showing all points from all the series in grey.  The user may choose to print or assign the object, or both.
Since the function generates a scatterplot of time-series plots, there are certain limits in the output.  If the user attempts to generate
the plot for a time-series matrix with more than 36 time-series, the user will be prompted to continue and prompted about whether they want
to include the background.  The prompts can be removed in the arguments of the function.
